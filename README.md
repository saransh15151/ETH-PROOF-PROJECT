# Project Title

understanding the basic functionality of Smart Contract

## Description

A contract consists of token name , abbrivation and many other things. Here we have use mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount and the burn function which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply and from the balance of the address.
